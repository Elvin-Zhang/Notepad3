# Notepad3
WPF-based Notepad clone, written to exercise the [AvalonEdit](http://avalonedit.net/) text editor component. 

## Why Notepad3?
For years, I've used [Notepad2](http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html) as my text editor, but it hasn't been updated in two years and I'm assuming it's now abandonware.

## Do we really need another Notepad clone?
Probably not. But it's scratching a programming itch for me, so leave me alone :)
